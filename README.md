The system identifies sensitive files, computes their hash values (SHA256) to verify integrity, and triggers alerts for unauthorized access or suspicious activity. It generates detailed logs and audit reports, providing a comprehensive view of file transfers and potential security violations.

The project provides hands-on experience in blue team security practices, including data loss prevention (DLP), file integrity monitoring, and insider threat detection, making it suitable for cybersecurity monitoring, digital forensics, and organizational compliance.
